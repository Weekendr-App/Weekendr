# ðŸª© Weekendr: Easy-To-Use Night Club/Party Finder
**Weekendr** is the ultimate tool for finding night clubs in your area. Whether you're into Techno, Hip-Hop, Metal (or whatever genre of music for that matter) *doesn't matter*. 

Use the *music genre filter* to find the music you want to listen to on the weekend with your friends.

## ðŸ’ª Motivation
I came up with the idea for Weekendr one day when I figured I didn't know many night clubs in my small home town. The problem is even if I knew I would have to check each night club's Instagram page to know which genre of music they would be playing over the weekend to know where I wanted to go. So I figured that wasn't ideal.

I tried searching online for a web application that could help me with my problem, but I couldn't find one. That's when I figured I needed to use my programming knowledge to good use. What started out as a small project I started solo later on I got help from one of my good [friends](https://github.com/zvonimirr) from college.
